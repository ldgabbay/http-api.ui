# HTTP API UI


## Usage

This UI can be hosted statically, as it pulls the API from a query string parameter. Syntax is:

`<site_root>/#/?src=<url>`

The URL can be relative to the site root or absolute.


```bash
npm run local
```

View the locally hosted code at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
